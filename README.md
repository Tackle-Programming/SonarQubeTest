# serialization-study
These are the notes I am creating while working through the Java serialization API. For each concept I encounter, I create a Listing to address that aspect of the serialization API. Each Listing contains unit tests to help pin down the behavior of the serialization API and comments to capture the essense of what is being demonstrated.

## Contents
- Listing 1: How to serialize and deserialize an object using ObjectOuputStream and ObjectInputStream
- Listing 2: How to control what members of a class are serialized (TODO: move static member considerations to sub-listing)
- Listing 3: Use of readObject and writeObject to control serialization form
